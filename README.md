This Python code creates a GUI application using Tkinter. The application provides two calculators on separate tabs.

1st Tab: Percentage Change Calculator:
It calculates the percentage change between an old value and a new value,
displaying the result along with step-by-step instructions for performing the calculation both on a desktop calculator and in Excel.

2nd Tab: Value Adjustment Calculator:
This calculator determines the new value after either an increase or decrease by a given percentage from an old value.
It also provides step-by-step instructions for both desktop and Excel calculations.

The GUI includes buttons for calculating results, clearing input fields, and toggling the visibility of the detailed calculation steps.
