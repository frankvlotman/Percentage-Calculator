This Python code creates a GUI app using Tkinter. The app provides two calculators on separate tabs.

1st Tab: Percentage Change Calculator:
Calculates the percentage change between an old value and a new value,
displaying the result with step-by-step instructions for performing the calculation on a desktop calculator and in Excel.

2nd Tab: Value Adjustment Calculator:
Determines the new value after either an increase or decrease by a given percentage from an old value.
It also provides step-by-step instructions for a desktop calculator and in Excel.

The GUI includes buttons for calculating results, clearing input fields, and toggling the visibility of the calculation steps.
